# Fire Up Your English Speaking

I was so ... excited today. I think I find a effective method to improve your speaking English. I will call it ***Insane Speaking***.

## Insane Speaking

The details of this method is:

1. Just pick up a new Chinese material.
2. DO NOT prepare!
3. **SPEAK** it loudly in English to express the same meaning.(5-10 minutes). If you get stuck, DO NOT stop!
4. **Record** your speaking with your smart phone or something else.
5. **Revise**. Figure out the word or sentence you do not know how to say. Put them on a note book.

## Stage One 

2019-11-12 to 2019-11-17

I will try this method for 7 days and upload my recording. After the first week I will check if there is any improvement.
